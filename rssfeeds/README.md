# RSS- and Atom-Feed Integration Service for Mattermost

This integration service posts RSS feeds into specific Mattermost channels by formatting output from html to text
via [Mattermost's incoming webhooks](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html). It can also be managed through [slash-commands](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/slash-commands.html).
